# Data Analysis on Underperforming Coaches and their firing rates in College Basketball
By Tony Rosler, Aaron Cronin and Thomas Hurtubise

Turnover at the head of college athletics teams is an interesting phenomenon.
These highly paid positions have their job performance televised and scrutinized by
sports analysts and commentators who pontificate on whether any given season may
be a coach's last. As a result, this report is motivated to explore one of the most salient
indicators of performance, the win-loss record for a coach over the course of a season,
to determine how this factor indicates whether a coach will be fired after that season.
One's intuition may predict that the performance of a college basketball team would
obviously portend to a coach's firing, but the empirical findings may murky that clear
heuristical picture.
